2. Algorithms

I have completed the entire Algorithms unit on Khan Academy, including all the challenges and projects.In this module I had learned a lot about binary search and recersian and many sorting types. This was cool to learn because in a previous computer science class I did a project on selection sort and to further understand these was very interesting and gained an interest to continue learning about it. 


3. Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation

I have also finished the Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation lesson on Khan Academy. In this I have learned a lot of different code like objects, functions and more. Here I have drawn a house according to the project given to me. Here we have many different objects together to make a image/ building of a house.
